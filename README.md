Marvelous Mobile Ruby Development
================================
Once Android began its coup of the mobile market, the desire for multi-platform development tools has been constant. As developers, DRY is beaten into us from early on in our journey and maintaining multiple code bases just feels wrong and wastes time. That said, many options out there require trade-offs, such as asking us to pay a large chunk of money, learn a non-standard DSL, or use non-native interfaces that confuse users. It doesn't have to be this way though ... what if we could not only use a developer friendly language, but also share the code where appropriate and have native apps that behave the way the user expects? 

In this session, we will build a basic "IMDB" for the Marvel universe that will run natively on both iOS and Android. We will cover the basics of using Ruby Motion and JRuby to build the app, as well tips and tricks along the way on how to easily share source, and discuss when itâ€™s appropriate to write OS specific code.

If the idea tickles your brain, then come join the discussion.
