Marvelous Mobile Ruby Development
================================
Once Android began its coup of the mobile market, the desire for multi-platform development tools has been constant. As developers, DRY is beaten into us as a best practice, and maintaining multiple code bases feels wrong and wastes time. That said, many options out there require trade-offs, such as asking us to pay a large chunk of money, learning non-standard DSL, or using non-native interfaces that confuse users. It doesn't have to be this way though ... what if we could not only use a developer friendly language, but also share the code where appropriate and have native apps that behave the way the user expects? 

In this session, we will build a basic "IMDB" for the Marvel universe that will run natively on both iOS and Android. Our tools will be Ruby Motion and JRuby. We will cover setting up the environment, the basics of using each, and some tips and tricks. Along the way, we will also touch on how to easily share source, and discuss when itâ€™s appropriate to write OS specific code. If the idea tickles your brain, come join the discussion.
