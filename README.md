Marvelous Mobile Ruby Development
================================
Once Android brought competition to the mobile market, the need for multi-platform development tools has been nearly constant due to the desire to reach the widest audience possible. DRY is beaten into developers as a best practice, and maintaining multiple code bases feels wrong and wastes time. That said, many options that enable a single code base also require concessions such as large chunks of money, learning non-standard DSL, or creating non-native interfaces that confuse users. It doesn't have to be this way though ... what if it were possible to create native apps which behave as the user expects, while reusing code written in a developer friendly language.

RubyMotion enables developers to build multi-platform mobile apps with ruby that run natively on iOS and Android. This session will cover setting up the environment, the basics of using the framework, a discussion on architecting to share code, and some tips and tricks learned through experience. A basic "IMDB" for the Marvel universe will be the canvas for the points discussed. Come join the discussion and gain some new superpowers along the way.
