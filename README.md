Marvelous Mobile Ruby Development
================================
Once Android began its coup of the mobile market, the desire for multi-platform development tools has been nearly constant. DRY is beaten into developers as a best practice, and maintaining multiple code bases feels wrong and wastes time. That said, many options out there require trade-offs, such as requiring large chunks of money, learning non-standard DSL, or creating non-native interfaces that confuse users. It doesn't have to be this way though ... what if it was possible to not only use a developer friendly language, but also share the code where appropriate and have native apps that behave the way the user expects? 

RubyMotion 3.0 enbles developers to build multi-platform mobile apps with ruby that run natively on iOS and Android. This session will cover setting up the environment, the basics of using the framework, a discussion on architecting to share code, and some tips and tricks learned through experience. A basic "IMDB" for the Marvel universe will be the canvas for the points discussed. Come join the discussion and gain some superpowers along the way.
